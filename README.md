# A Webshop JS Project

I'm a Front End student at Medieinstitutet (class FED24D) and this is my first ever JavaScript project. ðŸš€ The website allows users to browse and purchase 10 different products, and it includes a checkout form where users can provide their customer data and choose between two different payment methods. It includes discounts based on certain conditions such as what day it is, how many products you add to cart and how much the total is.

## Challanges

Since this was my first project with JavaScript, I had to learn a lot on the go. At first, working with functions, events and all that JS-jazz, was super confusing, and keeping track of everything was even more confusing. But despite the challanges, I learned a lot along the way. This project made me see how JavaScript, HTML and CSS can be used together to create something really cool! I look forward to making this webshop even better in the future. âœ¨

## Tech Stack
